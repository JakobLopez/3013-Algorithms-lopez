Description:
    This is an implementation of a binary search tree. Items with a lesser 
		value than the root will be placed to the root's left, and vice versa.
		Because the tree is ordered, it searches in O(logn) ,and in worst case
		scenario it's O(height).The tree is outputted to a file so that we can
		visualize it.

Files:
    main.cpp
    BSTree.cpp
