Description:
      This program loads vertices into a graph with no edges and connects them
		  to their closest,unvisited,unconnected neighbor. No vertex has a degree 
		  higher than the max degree defined. After the graph has been connected,
		  its information is displayed so we can compare the different starting
		  cities.
